#these are notes on doing this app.

*I had to put flex:1 on the safe area and the body in order to expand 
the body.
*the todo bar I added the value from props.
*for delete an Item from the array I used filter() and had to pass
the whole item object in the callBack func. in order to delete 1 item 
proberly. otherwise if I use the id or value it deletes random elements 
from the array.
*add item in the array is easy I used concat() I think I can use push().
*to dismiss the keyboard I added touchable without feedback to whole app
then imported the keyboard from react native and used {Keyboard.dismiss} 
on press.
*to get the index of the specific item I used arr.findIndex(callBack).
the callBack func. should look like this: obj => obj === item.
where item is the element I wanna update.
* to update the state of done of each items inside the array, I had to copy 
the current array of objects into new newArr and updated the value using the 
index then used useState to update current array into the new array.
